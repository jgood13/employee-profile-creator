# employee-profile-creator

## Description

This is a app that uses Inquirer to take in prompts for manager, engineer, and interns and then dynamically creates html for the info to go into so that it can be displayed in a webpage.

## How to use

To use this application you need to run 'node index.js' and then follow the prompts in the console. As soon as you're done inputting employees you can just click 'no' when it asks if you want to add more. Then a html page will be created in the dist folder. If you open that page in browser all employees will have cards added.
